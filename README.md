This repository contains the MATLAB code to simulate phyllotactic spirals using the disk-stacking model. The file simulate_model.m runs the simulation and can plot the disk-stacking model and/or the frequency graph of the parastichy lines. The radius can be varied using functions R2.m and R3.m and the initial condition is varied using initialcondition1.m.
All the code is in the folder Code.
